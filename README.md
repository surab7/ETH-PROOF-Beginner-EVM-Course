# SimpleToken Contract

SimpleToken is a basic Ethereum token implemented in Solidity. This contract includes functionality for minting, burning, and transferring tokens.

## Contract Details

- **Name**: Simple Token
- **Symbol**: STK
- **Solidity Version**: 0.8.18

## Features

- **Minting**: Create new tokens and add them to the total supply.
- **Burning**: Destroy tokens and reduce the total supply.
- **Transferring**: Transfer tokens from one address to another.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Truffle
- Ganache (for local development)
- Metamask (for interacting with the contract)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install dependencies.

### Deployment

1. Start Ganache.

2. Compile and deploy the contract using Truffle.

### Running in Remix IDE

1. Open Remix IDE.

2. Create a new file and copy the SimpleToken contract code into the file.

3. Select the appropriate compiler version (0.8.18).

4. Compile the contract.

5. Deploy the contract using the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.

6. Interact with the deployed contract using the available functions (mint, burn, transfer) from the Remix IDE interface.

## Contract Methods

### mint(address _to, uint _value)

Mints new tokens and assigns them to `_to`.

- Parameters:
  - `_to`: The address to receive the newly minted tokens.
  - `_value`: The amount of tokens to be minted.

### burn(address _from, uint _value)

Burns tokens from `_from`, reducing the total supply.

- Parameters:
  - `_from`: The address whose tokens will be burned.
  - `_value`: The amount of tokens to be burned.

### transfer(address _to, uint _value)

Transfers `_value` tokens from the sender's address to `_to`.

- Parameters:
  - `_to`: The address to receive the tokens.
  - `_value`: The amount of tokens to be transferred.

## Events

- **Transfer**: Emitted when tokens are transferred, including zero-address transfers for minting or burning.
- **Mint**: Emitted when new tokens are minted.
- **Burn**: Emitted when tokens are burned.
